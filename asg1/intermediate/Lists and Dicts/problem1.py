#Problem #1: List Practice
#Now practice writing code with lists! Implement the functionality described in the comments below.

#def main(): # Create a list called fruit_list that contains the following fruits: # 'apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'pineapple'.

# Print the length of the list.


# Add 'mango' at the end of the list.

# Print the updated list.





def main():
    
    fruit_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'pineapple']
    print("Length of the list:", len(fruit_list))
    fruit_list.append('mango')

    # Print the updated list.
    print("Updated fruit list:", fruit_list)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
